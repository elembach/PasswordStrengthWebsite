# Password Strength Testing Website
Super Awesome Cool Password Strength Program (SACPSP)

Created by Elizabeth Lembach & Sam Will

Summary:

This project creates a website that can validate and test the strength of a user-entered password. Passwords are validated 
using the following characteristics:
1. At least one uppercase letter
2. At least one lowercase letter
3. At least one special character(!,@,#,$,%,^,&,*,?, etc.)
4. At least one vowel(including y)
5. At least 8 characters long
The password's strength is then determined based on qualifications surrounding the length and the number of unique characters.
Both password strength and password validation occur within C++ files, which are run using a website. This project includes the usage of
C++, HTML, CSS, PHP, and Python(Note: Python is used to make graphs of password strength using Matplotlib, but there are still some issues with this function).
This project utilized starter code from Senior Lecturer at the University of Vermont, Lisa Dion. password_strength.cpp and password_validation.cpp files were written based on files Dion shared for a previous project. OE_Engine, OE_password, process.php, and style.css were all files Dion had provided for previous projects that were modified to create this project. 



Concepts used: 
* Languages: C++, Python, PHP, CSS, HTML
* Passing information from one language to another (via command line argument)
