Open Ended Project 3: Super Awesome Cool Password Strength Program (SACPSP)

Names: Elizabeth Lembach & Sam Will

Summary:

We made a website that checks the strength of a password. You ender in the password, it is checked to make sure it has
the correct parameters to be a valid password. That is, it checks the length to be >=8 characters long, has an
upper case, has a lower case, has a vowel, and has a special character. The strength of the password is then checked 
and given a score 0-5. The process is explained in the password_strength.cpp file. This information is all then displayed
on the web page, including a graph (BUT the graph doesn't display correctly).

Module 2 concepts: 
* Programming languages: C++, Python, PHP
* Other Languages: HTML, CSS
* Passing information from one language to another (via command line argument)

Bugs:

* The graph doesn't display

Future work (how you could expand the program with more time):
* Add the graph to the website
* Add the new password to the graph
* Add more strength checks

Grade We Think We Deserve:

We deserve 75 points because our project is really good. It implements multiple languages such as C++, python, HTML, PHP, and CSS.
We built upon the work we did on the Website Testing project to take it to the level of complexity desired for an Open-Ended project.
Our project is also very functional!
